# AdvancedScheduler Overview

The `AdvancedScheduler` package provides advanced and extensible [Julia](https://julialang.org/) events schedulers inspired by Python schedulers [APScheduler](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/), [schedule](https://github.com/dbader/schedule) and [sched](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sched.html).

Schedulers can use real time clock (system time) or simulated time (for simulation purpose).
